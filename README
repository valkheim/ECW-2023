# ECW ransomware recovery challenge

John Doe got his backup server hacked. John is broke, help him recover his data.

Find a way to recover the hackers private key.

# Steps

1. Explore the server archive and recover a first flag
2. Find the ty'conti domain used for infection
3. Recover your data, a flag is hidden within


## Scenario

Evil corp installed a malware on John's backup server. That malware is listening for a NUKE order on UDP/9999. When received, it verifies the origin of the request using a DGA and encrypts backup files. It then deletes the symmetric key but leaves an encrypted key for later recovery. Finally, it rewrites the bootleader with a ransom note and reboots.

We are John's friend and our task is to retrieve the secret key for backup files decryption. We have to reverse the malware (we can also restore the bootloader) in order to find the domain name used while the attack was launched. Luckily, we find the ransomware gang panel and from there we find the key and decrypt John's key and files in order to reveal the flag.

## Build instructions

First, build the cnc/implant softwares, generate crypto stuff with:

```
code/$ ./make.sh
```

note: you might need musl

Then create the john backup (I'm using a backup here):

```
image/$ 7z x alpine.qcow2.7z
image/$ ./50-boot.sh &
```

note: you might need to install qemu

At that point you should have an alpine linux and an ssh access for root:root on TCP/5555.

You can now push all the stuff to the backup server

```
image/$ ./60-push-files.sh
code/implant$ make send
```

On the backup server you should now have:

```
localhost:~# ls /root
implant  key      key.bin
localhost:~# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost.my.domain localhost localhost.localdomain localhost
::1             localhost localhost.localdomain
10.0.2.2 uxigxmxvm.bzh
```

and on the control panel:

```
$ head -n2 code/cnc/server/code/files/nGQ9xF84C/key.pem 
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKcwggSjAgEAAoIBAQCdU3ZPd9Jj/G2A
```

Perfect, now we can start the attack. One one end, launch the implant:

```
$ cd code/implant
code/implant/$ make run
```

And on the other end, send the NUKE message:

```
$ cd code/cnc/send_order
code/cnc/send_order$ ./cnc 127.0.0.0 9999 NUKE
Send command NUKE
```

You should now be able to read the ransom notice on your qemu window.
The alpine image is ready to be given to challengers.

Save the machine for the challenger:

```
image/$ qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw alpine.qcow2 infected.img
image/$ mv infected.img ../writeup
writeup$ tar czvf infected.tgz infected.img
writeup$ git add infected.tgz 
```

Now let's start the cnc panel. It must be reachable at the domain name generated the day of the attack. You can find it in your logs or regenerate it using the dga helper:

```
code/implant$ ./dga
uxigxmxvm.bzh
```

To start the cnc panel, use the docker-compose at code/cnc/server/docker-compose.yml

You should be able to access a private key at `localhost/files/nGQ9xF84C/key.pem`.

That key will be used to decrypt the primary key. You will then be able to decrypt John's files.
